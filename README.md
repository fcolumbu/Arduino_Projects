General Arduino Projects

This repository contains Arduino projects that do not fall in any particular category, in other words, general Arduino experimentation.

"DS75LV_thermometer" is a good example of the use of the I2C Bus since the bus has 2 devices, the Maxim DS75LV and the Seeed Studio RGB LCD display. Complete documentation for I2C can be found at https://www.i2c-bus.org/i2c-primer/ Please see other useful links in the introductory comments for specifics related to building the project.
